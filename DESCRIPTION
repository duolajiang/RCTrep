Description: Validates estimates of (conditional) average treatment effects obtained    using observational data by a) making it easy to obtain and visualize    estimates derived using a large variety of methods (G-computation, inverse propensity score weighting, etc.), and b) ensuring that estimates are    easily compared to a gold standard (i.e., estimates derived from randomized controlled    trials). RCTrep offers a generic protocol for treatment effect validation based on four    simple steps, namely, set-selection, estimation, diagnosis, and validation. The package    provides a simple dashboard to review the obtained results. The validation approach is introduced by Shen, L., Geleijnse, G. and Kaptein, M. (2023) <https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2559287/v1>.
