Description: The software compares and validate estimates of (conditional) average treatment effects obtained    using observational data by a) making it easy to obtain and visualize    estimates derived using a large variety of methods, and b) ensuring that estimates are    easily compared to a gold standard (i.e., estimates derived from randomized controlled    trials). RCTrep offers a generic protocol for treatment effect validation based on four    simple steps, namely, set-selection, estimation, diagnosis, and validation. The package    provides a simple dashboard to review the obtained results.
