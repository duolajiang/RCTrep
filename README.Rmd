# RCTrep

The goal of RCTrep is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of RCTrep from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("RCTrep")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("duolajiang/RCTrep")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(RCTrep)
## basic example code
library(RCTrep)
library(dplyr)

source.data <- RCTrep::source.data
target.data <- RCTrep::target.data

output <- RCTREP(Estimator="G_computation",
                 source.data=source.data, target.data=target.data,
                 vars_name=list(confounders_internal=c("Stage2","pT","age","BRAF"),
                                confounders_external=c("Stage2","pT","age","BRAF"),
                                treatment_name=c('combined_chemo'),
                                outcome_name=c('vitstat')),
                 stratification=c("Stage2","pT"))
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(source.obj = output$source.obj, target.obj = output$target.obj)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
output$source.obj$plot_CATE(stratification=c("Stage2","pT","BRAF"),stratification_joint = TRUE)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
